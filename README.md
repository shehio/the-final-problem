# The Final Problem
<p align="justify">
As you might have guessed, The Final Problem references The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. I named this project The Final Problem because, in computer science, a cluster of computers can solve any problem, so solving for the abstractions of distributed computing is the final problem I need to solve.

## The Plan
The plan is to create a stateful cluster that is able to communicate and solve problems where the nodes can communicate with one another. These nodes can split the workload amongst them based on their ability to compute (how socialist!). This cluster can be on AWS, [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), or Docker. They will also leverage new technology like [Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/), [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), and [Cadence](https://cadenceworkflow.io/).
