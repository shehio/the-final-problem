Note: I couldn't find the exact date of the games are not known (month/day), I added them to be in March when the weather is good in Cambridge.
There are minor bugs in the script and it doesn't handle edge cases, but that's not the point of this exercise.

For verification, connect to the cluster and in CQL: `SELECT * FROM games;` and `SELECT * FROM moves;` after selecting the right keyspace.
